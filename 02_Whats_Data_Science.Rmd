# What's Data Science and How Do I Do It?


## What's R?

R is a programming language that was developed by statisticians in the early 90s for use in the calculation and visualization of statistical applications. R is now one of the most widely used programming languages in the field of data science. Code in R does not have to be compiled, but can be used interactively and dynamically. This makes it possible to quickly gain basic knowledge about existing data and to display it graphically.
R offers much more than just programming, but also a complete system for solving statistical problems. A large number of packages and interfaces are available, with which the functionality can be expanded and integration into other applications is made possible.

### RStudio 

Install R and RStudio Locally
To get started you should install R and RStudio locally on your computer. Before we try to put in word how to do so: Here’s a [DataCamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/installing-R-windows-mac-ubuntu) on how to do that. If you struggle, we will help you with installing at the “Introduction to Coding” Workshop or at our first Coding Meetup
Until then, focus on learning the "hard skills" of programming with the courses on DataCamp.
That brings us to your curriculum in the next section!

### DataCamp courses and Curriculum

The following list shows the required DataCamp courses for the Data Science with `R` Track at TechAcademy.
As a beginner, please stick to the courses of the "beginner" program.
Ambitious beginners can, of course, take the advanced courses afterward.
However, it would be best if you worked through the courses in the order we listed them.

The same applies to the advanced courses.
Here, too, you should finish the specified courses in the given order.
Since it can, of course, happen that you have already mastered the topics of an advanced course, you can replace some courses.
If you are convinced that the course does not add value to you, feel free to replace it with one of the courses in the "Exchange Pool" (see list below).
However, you should not pursue an exchange course until you finish all chapters from the advanced course: "Intermediate R."

To receive the certificate, both beginners and advanced learners must complete at least 6 courses of the curriculum (6/9 courses).
For the beginners, this means until -- and including -- the course [Cleaning Data in R (4h)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-r) and for the advanced until --and including -- [Modeling with Data in the Tidyverse (4h)](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/modeling-with-data-in-the-tidyverse).
After completing the curriculum and the project's requirements, you will receive your TechAcademy certificate!

## What's Python?

`Python` is a dynamic programming language.
You can execute the code in the interpreter, so you do not have to compile the code first.
This feature makes `Python` very easy and quick to use.
The excellent usability, easy readability, and simple structuring were and still are core ideas in developing this programming language.

You can use `Python` to program according to any paradigm, whereby structured and object-oriented programming is most straightforward due to the structure of the language.
Still, functional or aspect-oriented programming is also possible.
These options give users significant freedom to design projects the way they want and great space to write code that is difficult to understand and confusing.
For this reason, programmers developed specific standards based on the so-called `Python` Enhancement Proposals (PEP) over the decades.

### Anaconda and Jupyter

Before you can use `Python`, you must install it on the computer.
`Python` is already installed on Linux and Unix systems (such as macOS), but often it is an older version.
Since there are differences in the handling of `Python` version 2 -- which is no longer supported -- and version 3, we decided to work with version 3.6 or higher.

One of the easiest ways to get Python and most of the best-known programming libraries is to install Anaconda.
There are detailed explanations for installing all operating systems on the [website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) of the provider.

With Anaconda installed, all you have to do is open the Anaconda Navigator, and you're ready to go.
There are two ways to get started: Spyder or Jupyter.
Spyder is the integrated development environment (IDE) for `Python` and offers all possibilities from syntax highlighting to debugging (links to tutorials below).

The other option is to use Jupyter or Jupyter notebooks.
It is an internet technology-based interface for executing commands.
The significant advantage of this is that you can quickly write shortcode pieces and try them out interactively without writing an entire executable program.
Now you can get started!

If you have not worked with Jupyter before, we recommend that you complete [this DataCamp course](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/introduction-to-projects/guided/Python) first.
There you will get to know many tips and tricks that will make your workflow with Jupyter much easier.

To make your work and, above all, the collaboration more accessible, we are working with the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) platform that contains a Jupyter environment with the necessary libraries.
You can then import all the data required for the project with Google Drive.
We will introduce this environment during our first Coding Meetup.
Until then, focus on learning the "hard skills" of programming with your courses on DataCamp.
This topic brings us to your curriculum in the next section!

However, you should not pursue an exchange course until you finish all chapters from the advanced course: "Intermediate Python."

To receive the certificate, both beginners and advanced learners must complete at least two-thirds of the curriculum (6/9 courses).
For the beginners, this means until -- and including -- the course "[Joining Data with pandas (4h)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-with-pandas)" and for the advanced until --and including -- "[Introduction to Linear Modeling in Python (4h)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-linear-modeling-in-python)." In addition, you should complete at least *two-thirds* of the project tasks.
After completing the curriculum and the project's (minimal) requirements, you will receive your TechAcademy certificate!

Now that you have learned the theoretical foundation of Data Science in the DataCamp courses, you can put your skills into practice. We have put together a project for you based on real data sets. You can read about the details of this project in the following chapters of this project guide. If you still feel a little unsure about how to start off, there will be a Coding Introduction on November 9, 2022, where we will give you a general sense on how to start off with Python or R. Of course, we will also describe the project. We will discuss everything you need to know during the first Coding Meetup, which will take place on November 23, 2022. After that, your work on the project will officially begin. You can find the exact project tasks together with further explanations and hints in the following chapters.
